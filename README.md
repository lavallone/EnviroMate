* **docker** folder contains the scripts to *build* and *run* the ***pepper-hri*** image.
* **src** folder is a copy of what it's contained in our local machines in "*/home/user_name/src*" (***modim*** and ***pepper-tools*** ).
* finally **pepper_interaction** is the main folder in which we developed all the code to make the interaction happens.
