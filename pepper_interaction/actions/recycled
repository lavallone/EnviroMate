<*,*,*,*>: The demand for sustainable packaging is increasing, and paper packaging is leading the way as the most recycled packaging material in Europe. In 2018, the recycling rate for paper and cardboard reached 82.9percent, surpassing metallic, glass, and plastic packaging. Since 1998, paper recycling has increased by 40percent, with the industry utilizing a significant amount of recycled content in production. The fiber used in corrugated board production is sourced from 94percent recycled paper, while carton board utilizes 35percent recycled paper. The European paper packaging industry aims to achieve a recycling rate of 90percent by 2030. To achieve this goal, the cross-value chain alliance, 4evergreen, has set intermediate targets to be met by 2025, including adopting recyclability evaluation protocols, establishing separate collection streams for all fiber-based packaging, sorting collected paper for recycling according to standards, and ensuring the recycling of all collected fiber-based packaging.
