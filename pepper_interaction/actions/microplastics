<*,*,*,*>: Plastic pollution in the ocean is a pressing environmental issue with devastating consequences for marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Plastic waste, which makes up 80percent of all marine pollution, is primarily caused by littering and improper disposal of disposable plastic items. Approximately 8 to 10 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year, and by 2050, it is projected that plastic will outweigh all fish in the sea. The majority of plastics produced in history still exist, as plastic can take 500-1000 years to degrade and often becomes microplastics without fully breaking down. Currently, there are an estimated 50-75 trillion pieces of plastic and microplastics in the ocean. Plastic pollution forms garbage patches in the ocean's gyres, with the Great Pacific garbage patch being the largest. The consequences of plastic pollution include harm to wildlife through ingestion, suffocation, entanglement, and transportation of invasive species. Microplastics have entered the food chain and pose risks to human health, causing developmental, neurological, reproductive, and immune disorders. Plastic production contributes to climate change as it is derived from fossil fuels, and when incinerated, it releases greenhouse gases. Plastic pollution also has economic costs, affecting tourism, fisheries, and clean-up efforts. To prevent plastic pollution, it is crucial to improve waste management, implement recycling, reduce the use of single-use plastics, and support legislation aimed at reducing plastic production and improving waste management systems. Individual actions such as reducing plastic use, participating in clean-up activities, and supporting research and organizations focused on plastic pollution are also important steps to combat plastic pollution in the ocean.
