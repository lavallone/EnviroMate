<*,*,*,*>: Fast fashion, characterized by the rapid production and distribution of affordable garments, has detrimental environmental impacts. The fashion industry is the second-largest consumer of water and accounts for about 10percent of global carbon emissions, surpassing those from international flights and maritime shipping combined. The production of clothing contributes to carbon emissions, water depletion, and pollution of rivers and streams. Additionally, the industry generates massive amounts of textile waste, with a significant portion ending up in landfills. Washing clothes releases microfibers into the ocean, adding to the problem of plastic pollution. Synthetic fibers used in fast fashion, such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic, take a long time to biodegrade and contribute to microplastic pollution. The energy-intensive processes involved in fiber production and cotton cultivation deplete resources and pose health risks due to pesticide use. Fast fashion also has social impacts, including exploitative labor practices and instances of forced and child labor in developing economies. The concept of slow fashion, emphasizing sustainable manufacturing practices and conscious consumption, has emerged as a response to these issues. Efforts to promote secondhand clothing, rental options, and sustainable sourcing practices are underway. Individuals can contribute by making mindful choices, supporting sustainable brands, and advocating for change. Governments play a crucial role in implementing regulations and supporting sustainable practices in the fashion industry. Overall, embracing slow fashion and adopting sustainable practices are crucial steps toward reducing the environmental and social impacts of fast fashion.
