<*,*,*,*>: Water pollution occurs when harmful substances contaminate bodies of water, posing risks to human health and the environment. It can be caused by agricultural practices, sewage and wastewater discharges, oil pollution, and the release of radioactive substances. Water pollution can affect groundwater, surface water, and ocean water. The effects of water pollution on human health are significant, leading to illnesses and even death. Contaminated drinking water can transmit waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid. Chemical pollutants in water can cause severe health problems, including cancer and hormone disruption. Water pollution also disrupts ecosystems and threatens plant and animal life. Algal blooms and eutrophication deplete oxygen levels and create dead zones. Chemicals and heavy metals contaminate aquatic life and accumulate in the food chain. Marine debris, particularly plastics, endangers marine species, while ocean acidification affects the survival of shellfish and coral. Individuals can play a role in preventing water pollution by reducing plastic consumption, properly disposing of chemicals and non-biodegradable items, maintaining vehicles to prevent leaks, practicing environmentally-friendly landscaping, and disposing of medications correctly. Being mindful of what goes down storm sewers and cleaning up litter are also important. Taking these steps helps in reducing water pollution and safeguarding this essential resource.
